      <h1>My Introduction to YouTube</h1>
      <h2>Super Mario Bros. Plushies</h2>

       <p><span>"Plushtube"</span> was one of—if not—my very first real memory of using YouTube. The earliest videos I remember watching were of these <br>
      Super Mario Bros. plushies engaging in a variety of activities and scenarios, whether it be mundane everyday situations like the ones <br>
      depicted in "Mario and Luigi Go Swimming" and "Mario and Luigi Go to the Park", absurd concepts like "25 Ways to Kill Yoshi", or even <br>
      embarking on an epic hero's journey that takes heavy inspiration from the Mario RPG games. These plush videos are what I consider a <br>
      precious part of old YouTube and I hold them dear to my heart for their unabashed <span>creativity</span>, brimming with pure, imaginative storytelling. <br> 
      A particular plush channel that I was heavily inspired by was Goomzilla. His channel is a prime example of this reimaginative storytelling, <br>
      channeling the plot of Mario's simple quest to find 5 stars to rescue Princess Peach and save the world through plushies and miniature set <br>
      pieces, all while needing almost no real dialogue to create such a compelling journey. Goomzilla's "Mario Quest" series and other similar <br>
      channels from my earliest years of YouTube have no doubt left a large influence on my personal creative growth, even to this day.
